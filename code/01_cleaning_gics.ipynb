    "### Justification for which types of Equity Securities were kept and dropped from the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the 9 subcategories for equity securities, we selectively retained data points that allowed for meaningful comparisons of financial metrics. This selection process was predicated on the ability to make like-for-like assessments across income statements (IS), balance sheets (BS), and cash flow statements (CFS), where corresponding line items were present. In certain cases, such as within the context of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), we acknowledged the absence of certain income statement line items like Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), rendering them noncomparable. Despite this discrepancy, the retention of REITs was justified due to the persistence of core top and bottom line similarities, exemplified by Revenue and Net Income.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that though we are including REITS in the EDA stage, their eventual exclusion may be necessary depending on our feature selection for financial metrics. For instance, metrics like gross profit margin (= (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue) would become incongruous because REITS do not specify COGS in their daily operations. Currently, we exercise caution in omitting non-mortgage REITs, particularly since they constitute 162 out of 237 values within the broader real estate sector. Removing their data points could substantially diminish the available sample size within this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we refrain from resorting to imputation techniques, as attributing numerical values that lack real-world significance would distort the data's integrity. Our approach prioritizes maintaining the meaningfulness of the financial metrics and their alignment within practical financial contexts.\n",
