    "Because the Polygon.io API call contained many missing data points, I explored other methods to attain this information:\n",

    "1. I webscraped the website MarketWatch to pull data on Cost of Revenue for Q2 2023. The MarketWatch scraping ultimately provided a __[403 Forbidden warning](https://developer.edgar-online.com/docs)__ that indicates that the server understands my request but refuses to authorize it. Because I did not receive this warning while web scraping for individual stocks such as APPL and TSLA, it seems that MarketWatch rejects my calling of >2,000 hits to its server wihtin a small time frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I then considered using the SEC's website Edgar which has API documentation __[here](https://developer.edgar-online.com/docs)__. However, when attempting to register for my API, the Edgar website reveals that it is __[not accepting new registrants](https://developer.edgar-online.com/member/register)__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I next tried a python wrapper called __[SEC-API](https://pypi.org/project/sec-api/)__, an API that allows for EDGAR filings queries and real-time streams of the entire SEC filing corpus, encompassing over 650 terabytes of data. My free API key was created using __[sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Python wrapper, the QueryApi module did not meet my needs because the API provides a URL link to access the 10-Q statements, but does not allow me to index into the Cost of Revenues line item specifically. With this limitation, I would have to research each line item manually. The same problem occurred with a different module called \"FullTextSearchAPI\" in which the filing URL was provided but the line items within the financial statements were not."

Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 256 million and $ 121 million for six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2023, we expect to recognize $ 747 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period. \\n\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 234 million and $ 128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 1.15 billion and $ 665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits \\n\\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022 , we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. \\n\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue \\n\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program \\n\\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $ 76 million and $ 177 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 57 million and $ 133 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $ 133 million and $ 398 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 82 million and $ 246 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. \\n\\nLease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nJune 30, 2023 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nGross lease receivables \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nUnearned interest income \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 96 \\n\\n) \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 95 \\n\\n) \\n\\nAllowance for expected credit losses \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 6 \\n\\n) \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 4 \\n\\n) \\n\\nNet investment in sales-type leases \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nReported as: \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOther non-current assets \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nNet investment in sales-type leases \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment \\n\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales \\n\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 1.10 billion and $ 863 million, respectively, mainly due to billings for milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 329 million and $ 79 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 814 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 207 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. \\n\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 28 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 504 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. \\n\\nIncome Taxes \\n\\nThere are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.01 billion and $ 870 million, respectively, of which $ 601 million and $ 572 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. \\n\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. \\n\\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time. \\n\\n&#160;

\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \\n\\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we had $ 330 million and $ 753 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \\n\\nFinancing Receivables \\n\\nAs of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only immaterial balances being past due. As of June 30, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. \\n\\nAs of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 272 million and $ 280 million, respectively, of which $ 7 million was due in the next 12 months as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million. \\n\\nConcentration of Risk \\n\\nCredit Risk \\n\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily comprised of deposits which are diversified among high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , no entity represented 10 % or more of our total receivables balance. \\n\\nSupply Risk \\n\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \\n\\nOperating Lease Vehicles \\n\\nThe gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.13 billion and $ 6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.19 billion and $ 1.04 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. \\n\\nGoodwill \\n\\nGoodwill increased $ 69 million within the automotive segment from $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 263 million as of June 30, 2023 primarily from a business combination. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWarranties \\n\\nAccrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions): \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThree Months Ended June 30, \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nSix Months Ended June 30, \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAccrued warranty&#8212;beginning of period \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n3,965 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,287 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n3,505 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,101 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWarranty costs incurred \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 296 \\n\\n) \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 187 \\n\\n) \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 576 \\n\\n) \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n( 338 \\n\\n) \\n\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nProvision for warranty \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n1,140 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAccrued warranty&#8212;end of period \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n4,465 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,433 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n4,465 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,433 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \\n\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements \\n\\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 % on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $ 1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the impact was primarily a reduction of our material costs. We will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nNote 2 &#8211; Fair Value of Financial Instruments \\n\\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221; ) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nJune 30, 2023 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nFair Value \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel I \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel II \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel III \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nFair Value \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel I \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel II \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nLevel III \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nMoney market funds \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,188 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,188 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nU.S. government securities \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n3,811 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n3,811 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nCorporate debt securities \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nCertificates of deposit and time deposits \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n3,508 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n3,508 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n4,253 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n4,253 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n8,052 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n7,927 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n8,220 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n2,188 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n6,032 \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#8212; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAll of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets.

Should the closing price conditions continue to be met in a future quarter for the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Notes will be convertible at their holders&#8217; option during the immediately following quarter. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nNote 8 &#8211; Equity Incentive Plans \\n\\nOther Performance-Based Grants \\n\\n2021 Performance-Based Stock Option &#38; Restricted Stock Unit (&#8220;RSU&#8221;) Awards \\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options to purchase an aggregate 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of June 30, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 140 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.75 years. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded $ 20 million and $ 45 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $ 34 million and $ 103 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures. \\n\\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information \\n\\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions): \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThree Months Ended June 30, \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nSix Months Ended June 30, \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nCost of revenues \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nResearch and development \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nSelling, general and administrative \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n$ \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nNote 9 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies \\n\\nOperating Lease Arrangements in Buffalo, New York and Shanghai, China \\n\\nFor a description of our operating lease arrangements in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, we expect to meet the requirements under these arrangements based on our current and anticipated level of operations. \\n\\nLegal Proceedings \\n\\nLitigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition \\n\\nBetween September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (&#8220;SolarCity&#8221;). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. \\n\\nOn April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023, and on June 6, 2023, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery&#8217;s decision. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. \\n\\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award \\n\\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants&#8217; answer was filed on December 3, 2019. \\n\\nOn January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff&#8217;s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is &#8220;skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts&#8221; and the &#8220;case is going to trial,&#8221; but that the &#8220;parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.&#8221; Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. \\n\\nLitigation Related to Directors&#8217; Compensation \\n\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla&#8217;s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. \\n\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla will provide notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court will hold a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023. The general terms, conditions and timing of this proposed settlement are further set forth in the Form 8-K filed on July 20, 2023, which includes, among other things, the court-approved notice of the proposed settlement. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. \\n\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction \\n\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending the entry of judgment in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. \\n\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company&#8217;s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company&#8217;s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys&#8217; fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until September 5, 2023. \\n\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (&#8220;JP Morgan&#8221;) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan&#8217;s adjustment as a violation of the parties&#8217; agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. \\n\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment \\n\\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla&#8217;s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury&#8217;s damages. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla&#8217;s motion in part, reducing the total damages and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff&#8217;s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, which commenced on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $ 3,175,000 . As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $ 136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $ 15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $ 3.175 million (April 3, 2023). \\n\\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (&#8221;CRD,&#8221; formerly &#8220;DFEH&#8221;) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD&#8217;s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is now in discovery. \\n\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (&#8220;EEOC&#8221;) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD&#8217;s allegations. Tesla engaged in a mandatory mediation with the EEOC in June 2023, which did not result in a resolution. \\n\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys&#8217; fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants replied on February 17, 2023. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services \\n\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits, including proposed class actions, that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company&#8217;s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term &#8220;Full Self-Driving Capability&#8221; (FSDC), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSDC and deactivate FSDC on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSDC. Tesla opposed the motion. \\n\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company&#8217;s Autopilot and FSDC technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. On April 13, 2023, a putative Tesla shareholder filed a related shareholder derivative complaint against the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors and certain current and former executives, alleging contribution for violations of the federal securities law, breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and unjust enrichment. The complaint asserts derivative claims and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. \\n\\nOn March 14, 2023 a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. \\n\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted. \\n\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters \\n\\nWe receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. \\n\\nFor example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk&#8217;s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. \\n\\nSeparately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position. \\n\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly, among other things, non-public Tesla business and personal information. While Tesla&#8217;s investigation remains ongoing, we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities.

Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):    Three Months Ended June 30,   Six Months Ended June 30,           Automotive sales  $ 20,419   $ 13,670   $ 39,297   $ 29,184  Automotive regulatory credits            1,023  Energy generation and storage sales   1,359       2,772    1,220  Services and other   2,150    1,466    3,987    2,745  Total revenues from sales and services   24,210    16,197    46,859    34,172  Automotive leasing         1,131    1,256  Energy generation and storage leasing             Total revenues  $ 24,927   $ 16,934   $ 48,256   $ 35,690   Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Deferred revenue is related to the access to our Full Self Driving (&#8220;FSD&#8221;) features and ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales, which amounted to $ 3.17 billion and $ 2.91 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 256 million and $ 121 million for six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2023, we expect to recognize $ 747 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period. We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 234 million and $ 128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 1.15 billion and $ 665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.  Automotive Regulatory Credits During the six months ended June 30, 2022 , we had also recognized $ 288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $ 76 million and $ 177 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 57 million and $ 133 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $ 133 million and $ 398 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $ 82 million and $ 246 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue. Lease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):   June 30, 2023   December 31, 2022  Gross lease receivables $   $  Unearned interest income  ( 96 )   ( 95 ) Allowance for expected credit losses   ( 6 )   ( 4 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $   $         Reported as:      Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $   $  Other non-current assets       Net investment in sales-type leases $   $  Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 1.10 billion and $ 863 million, respectively, mainly due to billings for milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 329 million and $ 79 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 814 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 207 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $ 28 million and $ 24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $ 504 million and $ 387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Income Taxes There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $ 1.01 billion and $ 870 million, respectively, of which $ 601 million and $ 572 million, respectively, would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2015 to 2018 . Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.  Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):    Three Months Ended June 30,   Six Months Ended June 30,           Net income attributable to common stockholders  $ 2,703   $ 2,259   $ 5,216   $ 5,577  Less: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest         ( 5 )    Net income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock   2,703    2,256    5,221    5,569  Less: Dilutive convertible debt             Net income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock  $ 2,703   $ 2,256   $ 5,221   $ 5,568   The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the three -for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Stock Split&#8221;) (in millions):    Three Months Ended June 30,   Six Months Ended June 30,           Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, basic   3,171    3,111    3,168    3,107  Add:             Stock-based awards             Convertible senior notes             Warrants             Weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock, diluted   3,478    3,464    3,473    3,469   The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split (in millions):   Three Months Ended June 30,   Six Months Ended June 30,          Stock-based awards                          Restricted Cash Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):    June 30,   December 31,   June 30,   December 31,           Cash and cash equivalents  $ 15,296   $ 16,253   $ 18,324   $ 17,576  Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets             Restricted cash included in other non-current assets             Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  $ 15,879   $ 16,924   $ 18,887   $ 18,144     Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we had $ 330 million and $ 753 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Financing Receivables As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only immaterial balances being past due. As of June 30, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $ 272 million and $ 280 million, respectively, of which $ 7 million was due in the next 12 months as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 37 million. Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily comprised of deposits which are diversified among high credit quality financial institutions or invested in U.S. government securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , no entity represented 10 % or more of our total receivables balance. Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Operating Lease Vehicles The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.13 billion and $ 6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $ 1.19 billion and $ 1.04 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. Goodwill Goodwill increased $ 69 million within the automotive segment from $ 194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $ 263 million as of June 30, 2023 primarily from a business combination.  Warranties Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):    Three Months Ended June 30,   Six Months Ended June 30,           Accrued warranty&#8212;beginning of period  $ 3,965   $ 2,287   $ 3,505   $ 2,101  Warranty costs incurred   ( 296 )   ( 187 )   ( 576 )   ( 338 ) Net changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign exchange impact             Provision for warranty         1,140     Accrued warranty&#8212;end of period  $ 4,465   $ 2,433   $ 4,465   $ 2,433  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15 % on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $ 1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the impact was primarily a reduction of our material costs. We will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.  Note 2 &#8211; Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221; ) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):   June 30, 2023   December 31, 2022    Fair Value   Level I   Level II   Level III   Fair Value   Level I   Level II   Level III  Money market funds  $   $   $ &#8212;   $ &#8212;   $ 2,188   $ 2,188   $ &#8212;   $ &#8212;  U.S. government securities   3,811    &#8212;    3,811    &#8212;       &#8212;       &#8212;  Corporate debt securities      &#8212;       &#8212;       &#8212;       &#8212;  Certificates of deposit and time deposits   3,508    &#8212;    3,508    &#8212;    4,253    &#8212;    4,253    &#8212;  Total  $ 8,052   $   $ 7,927   $ &#8212;   $ 8,220   $ 2,188   $ 6,032   $ &#8212;    All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):   June 30, 2023   Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Short-Term Investments  Cash  $ 15,023   $ &#8212;   $ &#8212;   $ 15,023   $ 15,023   $ &#8212;  Money market funds      &#8212;    &#8212;          &#8212;  U.S. government securities   3,813    &#8212;    ( 2 )   3,811       3,663  Corporate debt securities      &#8212;    ( 14 )      &#8212;     Certificates of deposit and time deposits   3,511    &#8212;    ( 3 )   3,508    &#8212;    3,508  Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments  $ 23,094   $ &#8212;   $ ( 19 )  $ 23,075   $ 15,296   $ 7,779    December 31, 2022   Adjusted Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Short-Term Investments  Cash  $ 13,965   $ &#8212;   $ &#8212;   $ 13,965   $ 13,965   $ &#8212;  Money market funds   2,188    &#8212;    &#8212;    2,188    2,188    &#8212;  U.S. government securities      &#8212;    ( 3 )      &#8212;     Corporate debt securities      &#8212;    ( 22 )      &#8212;     Certificates of deposit and time deposits   4,252       &#8212;    4,253       4,153  Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments  $ 22,209   $   $ ( 25 )  $ 22,185   $ 16,253   $ 5,932   We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were temporary in nature. The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated contractual maturities as of June 30, 2023 (in millions):  Due in 1 year or less  $ 7,207  Due in 1 year through 5 years   Due in 5 years through 10 years   Total  $ 7,779  Disclosure of Fair Values Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, digital assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair values, other than our 2.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 (&#8220;2024 Notes&#8221;) and digital assets. We estimate the fair value of the 2024 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our digital assets based on quoted prices in active markets (Level I).

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded write-downs of $ 66 million and $ 105 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded write-downs of $ 23 million and $ 49 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.

Legal Proceedings Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (&#8220;SolarCity&#8221;). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $ 43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March 29, 2023, and on June 6, 2023, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery&#8217;s decision.  These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants&#8217; answer was filed on December 3, 2019. On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties&#8217; joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff&#8217;s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff&#8217;s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is &#8220;skeptical that this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts&#8221; and the &#8220;case is going to trial,&#8221; but that the &#8220;parties may reassert their arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.&#8221; Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing and argument are now complete. Litigation Related to Directors&#8217; Compensation On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla&#8217;s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla will provide notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court will hold a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023. The general terms, conditions and timing of this proposed settlement are further set forth in the Form 8-K filed on July 20, 2023, which includes, among other things, the court-approved notice of the proposed settlement. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023.  Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending the entry of judgment in the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company&#8217;s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company&#8217;s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys&#8217; fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until September 5, 2023. On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (&#8220;JP Morgan&#8221;) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk&#8217;s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan&#8217;s adjustment as a violation of the parties&#8217; agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $ 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court. Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla , a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla&#8217;s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for a new trial or reduction of the jury&#8217;s damages. On April 13, 2022, the Court granted Tesla&#8217;s motion in part, reducing the total damages and conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff&#8217;s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, which commenced on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $ 3,175,000 . As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from an initial $ 136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $ 15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $ 3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (&#8221;CRD,&#8221; formerly &#8220;DFEH&#8221;) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD&#8217;s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is now in discovery. Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (&#8220;EEOC&#8221;) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD&#8217;s allegations. Tesla engaged in a mandatory mediation with the EEOC in June 2023, which did not result in a resolution. On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla&#8217;s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys&#8217; fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants replied on February 17, 2023.   Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services We are also subject to various lawsuits, including proposed class actions, that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company&#8217;s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term &#8220;Full Self-Driving Capability&#8221; (FSDC), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSDC and deactivate FSDC on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSDC. Tesla opposed the motion. On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company&#8217;s Autopilot and FSDC technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. On April 13, 2023, a putative Tesla shareholder filed a related shareholder derivative complaint against the members of Tesla&#8217;s board of directors and certain current and former executives, alleging contribution for violations of the federal securities law, breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and unjust enrichment. The complaint asserts derivative claims and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On March 14, 2023 a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted. Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries. For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk&#8217;s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended. Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly, among other things, non-public Tesla business and personal information. While Tesla&#8217;s investigation remains ongoing, we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in this or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.
